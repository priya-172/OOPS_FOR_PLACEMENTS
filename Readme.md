comparison of encapsulation and abstraction in a column format:

| Aspect               | Encapsulation                         | Abstraction                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Bundling data and methods into a class, controlling access. | Simplifying complex systems, focusing on essential details. |
| **Purpose**          | Hide internal details, provide controlled access to data. | Provide a simplified view, emphasizing essential characteristics. |
| **Access Control**   | Uses access modifiers (e.g., private, public) to control visibility. | Primarily focuses on exposing essential behaviors, not access control. |
| **Implementation**   | Private variables, getter/setter methods for data access. | Abstract classes, interfaces to define blueprints and contracts. |
| **Example**          | Bank account (hide balance, control deposits/withdrawals). | Car (focus on driving, hide engine/transmission complexities). |
